# AI in Math — Map of Content

**This MOC is a curated reading path for AI applied to mathematics** — covering formal theorem proving (LLM-based agents), RL training for mathematical reasoning, ML-guided mathematical discovery, and the 2026 wave of agent-driven research results. Four sub-areas, 23 notes (2017–2026). Navigate here when you want to understand the state of the art, what's settled, and what remains open.

Cross-cluster: papers in this MOC that are relevant to the Burnside/Mixer program are flagged with ⚡.
