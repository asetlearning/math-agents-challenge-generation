# GAP: Compute group order

**Task:** Given a finitely presented group, compute |G|.

**Verified on:** GAP 4.15.1 at `/opt/homebrew/bin/gap`, 2026-05-28.

## Method 1: SmallGroups library (for groups of small order)

```gap
gap> G := SmallGroup(6, 1);
<pc group of size 6 with 2 generators>
gap> Order(G);
6
gap> IdGroup(G);
[ 6, 1 ]
```

**Output (verbatim):**
```
<pc group of size 6 with 2 generators>
6
[ 6, 1 ]
```

## Method 2: Finitely presented group

```gap
gap> F := FreeGroup("a", "b");;
gap> a := F.1;; b := F.2;;
gap> # S3 = <a,b | a^2 = b^3 = (ab)^2 = e>
gap> G := F / [a^2, b^3, (a*b)^2];;
gap> Order(G);
6
```

**Output (verbatim):**
```
6
```

**Note:** `Order(G)` on a finitely presented group uses coset enumeration internally. It will not terminate if G is infinite (or too large). For very large finite groups, use KBMAG to get a confluent rewriting system first, then enumerate.

## When to use

- Use `SmallGroup(n, k)` when you know the order and want one specific group.
- Use FPG presentation + `Order(G)` when you have a presentation and want to verify finiteness.
- If `Order(G)` hangs: the group may be infinite, or the order is too large for coset enumeration. Switch to KBMAG or the nilpotent quotient algorithm.
