# Burnside Groups — Map of Content

**This MOC is a curated reading path for the Burnside group program** — from the foundational B(2,5) computation (1974) through the open B(2,5) finiteness question, to the B(4,3) Mixer breakthrough (2025). Navigate here when you want to understand where we are, what's settled, and what's open on Burnside groups.

## Odd-exponent bound record & small-cancellation program (2023–2026, general Burnside theory)

Not B(2,5)-specific — the broader question of the smallest odd exponent n proven to give an infinite free Burnside group B(m,n). Scanned 2026-07-31 for Lead's B(2,5)-push literature request.

- [[_synthesis-odd-exponent-state-2026]] — full synthesis: n≥665 (Adian 1975) remains the field-accepted bound; n≥557 (Atkarskaya–Rips–Tent 2023) and n≥101 (Adian 2015) are both published/preprint claims that have NOT cleared independent community verification. Nothing found narrows exponent 5 or 7 directly. Power-free-word growth-rate literature ([[Concepts/power-free-word-growth-rates]]) is exponential for 5th powers but has no published bridge to Adian's actual proof apparatus — not usable as B(2,5) evidence.
- [[atkarskaya-rips-tent-2023]], [[adian-2015-odd-bound]], [[lysenok-2023-sample-iterated-sc]], [[atkarskaya-kanelbelov-plotkin-rips-2021-sc-rings]], [[gorshkov-2026-moufang-axial-algebra]], [[obrien-vaughanlee-2002-r27]], [[shur-2010-power-free-growth-rates]] — individual paper notes.
- [[_synthesis-gorshkov-axial-algebra-r2-2026]] — R2 deep-read of the Gorshkov preprint: precise Corollary 1 statement, confirms the group object is genuinely free B(2,5).⟨t⟩ (not a restricted-quotient trap — the index-2 extension step is elementary/harmless), lists 4 concrete computability items with cost estimates, author track record (credible, established) and citation status (none found, too recent).

## Foundational papers

- [[havas-wall-wamsley-1974]] — The 1974 paper that establishes |B(2,5)| = 5^34, class 12, via two independent methods; defines the generator numbering 1–34 that is the source of all `comm_X_Y` naming in B(2,5) experiments. Read this before anything else on B(2,5).

- [[havas-newman-1980]] — 1980 survey contextualizing B(2,5) within the broader Burnside program; gives |B(4,3)| = 2^69, class 7 — the 1977 baseline against which the Mixer's B(4,3) result must be compared. Source of the "apply several different techniques to the same problem" framing.

---

## The open problem

- [[kourovka-11.48-kostrikin-1990]] — Mathematical analysis of Kostrikin's Problem 11.48 (1990): B(2,5) is infinite iff the weight-7 commutator `[[[[[[x,y],y],y],y],y],y]` is not a product of 5th powers in F(x,y). The formal statement of what "success" means for all B(2,5) experiments.

- [[kourovka-2022]] — Source of Problem 11.48 in the Kourovka Notebook No. 20; confirms the problem is open as of 2022. Also contains Problem 4.2b (Adian) and the Gröbner-relevant problems 7.25 and 11.10b.

- [[b-exponent-5-adian-4.2b]] — Adian's equivalent framing (1973): do infinite finitely generated groups of exponent 5 exist? Equivalent to Problem 11.48 for m=2. Broader perspective when the B(2,5) result generalizes to B(m,5).

## Mixer attack

- [[b25-finiteness-11.48-kostrikin]] — Researcher's strategic note: why KB mixing is the right tool for Problem 11.48, what the B(4,3) precedent shows, and what we don't yet know about B(2,5). The Mixer-attack angle, distinct from the mathematical analysis in [[kourovka-11.48-kostrikin-1990]].

- [[algo-mixing-burnside-slides]] — The B(4,3) breakthrough (2025): two KB orderings cooperating via rule injection in 33 minutes, 2,333 rules, confluence verified. Verbatim run logs and B(4,3) relators. The proof-of-concept for all subsequent Burnside experiments.

## Cayley-table-closure attack (Kuznetsov line, Russian, 2009–2010)

A third algorithmic family for B(2,5): Cayley-table closure on a length-truncated minimal-word set. Distinct from KB completion and coset enumeration; provides a clean finite/infinite dichotomy and a list of 973 candidate-divergence relations at lengths 30–35 in $B_0(2,5)$ whose failure in $B(2,5)$ would prove infiniteness.

- [[kuznetsov-shlepkin-2009]] — Introduces Algorithm I (row-collision-based Cayley-table closure) on free Burnside groups. Computes $K_{27}(2,5)$ on a personal computer; $|P_{27}(2,5)| = 92{,}228{,}348$ exact minimal-word count, $|C_{27}| = 3{,}995$ relations. Proves $B(2,5)$ and $B_0(2,5)$ have identical minimal-word relations up to length 27.

- [[kuznetsov-tarasov-shlepkin-2009]] — Generalizes Algorithm I to arbitrary finitely-presented periodic groups. Useful for the algorithm's standalone statement; positions it against coset enumeration as a complementary technique.

- [[kuznetsov-shlepkin-2010]] — Refines detection (associativity-test variant); cluster-scale computation of $K_{35}(2,5)$ (~104 hours, 125 nodes, $|P_{35}| \approx 5^{14}$, $|C_{35}| = 104{,}409$). Theorem 3: $B(2,5) \sim B_0(2,5)$ coincide on minimal-word relations up to length 29. **Theorem 4: produces 973 explicit candidate-divergence relations at lengths 30–35; failure of any one in $B(2,5)$ would resolve Problem 11.48 in the negative (B(2,5) infinite).**

- [[_synthesis-kuznetsov-b25-algorithmic-line]] — Synthesis of the three Kuznetsov papers. Frames the Mixer / B(2,5) verification opportunities: $|P_s(2,5)|$ baseline check, direct test of the 2 length-30 candidate relations, pre-registration of a Kuznetsov-Algorithm-I Mixer Agent for multi-witness cross-checking.

### Kuznetsov — growth functions, Cayley graph diameters, and rewriting systems (2013–2025)

Later papers in the Kuznetsov line (mostly 3-page conference notes in Prikl. Diskr. Mat. Suppl.), advancing computational work on $B_0(2,5)$ quotients and subgroups.

- [[kuznetsov-2019]] — Computes Cayley graph diameters $D_{A_4}(B_k)$ for the 34 lower central quotients of $B_0(2,5)$; proposes and verifies (for $k \le 19$) the hypothesis that the diameter equals that of a half-sized normal subgroup. Growth-function angle; unproven hypothesis.

- [[kuznetsov-2020]] — Presents an algorithm computing a confluent irreducible rewriting system for any finite group given a generating set; applies to exponent-5 two-generator groups via Hall polynomial multiplication. Directly relevant to understanding what a successful Mixer B(2,5) run must produce.

- [[kuznetsov-kuznetsova-2025]] — Supercomputer computation of the explicit center of $B_0(2,5)$: central elements as minimal-length words over the symmetric generating set. Central elements are cross-ordering consistency anchors for the Mixer pipeline.

### Kuznetsov — subgroup structure (2010–2021)

- [[kuznetsov-filippov-2010-sjim]] — Foundational structural result: centralizer of the inversion automorphism $\varphi: a_i \mapsto a_i^{-1}$ of $B_0(2,5)$; computes generators, order ($5^{16}$), solvability length, nilpotency length.
- [[kuznetsov-filippov-2010-vmj]] — Shorter companion to the above; same result including lower and upper central series. Different venue (Vladikavkaz Math. J.).
- [[kuznetsov-2011]] — Structure of $G = \langle xy, yx \rangle \le B_0(2,5)$: order $5^{14}$, nilpotency class 6, derived length 3. Proves $G$ is the largest 2-generated exponent-5 group of nilpotency class 6.
- [[kuznetsov-kuznetsova-2021]] — Computes the minimum word length (16) for noncyclic abelian subgroups in $B_0(2,5)$; finds an abelian subgroup of order 25.

### Kuznetsov — Cayley graph geometry of centralizers (2017–2018)

- [[kuznetsov-kuznetsova-2017]] — Cayley graph of centralizer of a permutation-type order-2 automorphism ($|C| = 5^{17}$): diameter $D_X(C) = 33$, average diameter $\approx 26.1$.
- [[kuznetsov-safonov-2018]] — Cayley graphs of centralizer of the inversion automorphism ($|C| = 5^{16}$): growth functions, diameters, average diameters computed for multiple generating sets.

### Cross-exponent Hall polynomial work (2014–2015, borderline inclusions)

Included for methodology cross-validation: the Hall polynomial multiplication technique used throughout the B(2,5) computational line also works for exponents 3 and 7.

- [[kuznetsov-safonov-2014]] — Hall's polynomials for two-generator exponent-7 groups ($k \le 4$). Same method as [[kuznetsov-kuznetsova-2013]] applied to exponent 7.
- [[kuznetsov-safonov-2015]] — Hall's polynomials for exponent-3 Burnside groups ($k \le 4$), conference note. Companion to [[kuznetsov-2015-cayley-exp3]].
- [[kuznetsov-2015-cayley-exp3]] — Full paper: Hall polynomials + Cayley graph diameters for exponent-3 Burnside groups ($k \le 4$). Cayley graphs beat hypercubes in graph-theoretic properties.
