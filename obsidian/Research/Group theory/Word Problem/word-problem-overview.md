# Word Problem — Directory Map

This directory covers the word problem in finitely presented groups as a topic: decidability, specific algorithmic techniques, and target word methodology.

## Contents

| File | Scope |
|---|---|
| `decidability-landscape.md` | The word problem statement; Novikov-Boone undecidability for FPGs; decidability results for specific families (free, abelian, hyperbolic, automatic). Verbatim theorem citations. |
| `target-words.md` | What a "target word" is in our methodology (stated generally); how to construct one; how to verify equality. |
| `techniques/` | One note per technique: Knuth-Bendix completion, Dehn function, automatic groups via finite-state automata. Cross-linked to `Tools/GAP/examples/` and `Tools/KBMAG/examples/` where applicable. |

## What does NOT live here

- Tool-specific code → `Tools/GAP/` or `Tools/KBMAG/`
- Foundational group definitions → `General/basics/`
- Paper summaries about specific word-problem results → `Open problems/` or `Burnside groups/`
