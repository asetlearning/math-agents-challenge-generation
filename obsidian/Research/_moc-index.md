# Research MOC Index

This is the **entry point for all topic Maps of Content** in the Research/ subtree. Agents start here to navigate the research subtrees. Each MOC is a curated, annotated reading path — not a dump of all links in a folder.

## Group Theory MOCs

- [[Research/Group theory/_MOCs/_moc-burnside]] — **Burnside groups**: foundational papers (Havas-Wall-Wamsley 1974), open finiteness problem (11.48, Kourovka), Mixer attack (B(4,3) breakthrough), Cayley-table-closure attack (Kuznetsov line, 20 papers). Navigate when: you need to understand where B(2,5) sits in the literature or what the computational program looks like.

- [[Research/Group theory/_MOCs/_moc-knuth-bendix]] — **Knuth-Bendix completion**: the technique itself, KBMAG tools, the Mixer extension (rule injection), Gröbner alternative. Navigate when: you want to understand or run KB completion in a group-theory context.

- [[Research/Group theory/_MOCs/_moc-word-problem]] — **Word problem in FPGs**: decidability landscape (Novikov-Boone undecidability; decidable subclasses), algorithms (KB, TC, automatic groups), target words, open boundary cases (2-relator, B₄ membership). Navigate when: you want the full picture of what's decidable and which algorithm to choose.

- [[Research/Group theory/_MOCs/_moc-presentations-and-orders]] — **Group presentations and order**: free groups, presentation syntax, coset enumeration, group order computation, Cayley graphs. Navigate when: you need to specify a group computationally or understand how structure is computed from a presentation.

## AI in Math MOC

- [[Research/AI in Math/_MOCs/_moc-ai-in-math]] — **AI applied to mathematics**: formal theorem proving (GPT-f, HyperTree, AlphaGeometry, AlphaProof, DeepSeek-Prover-V2), RL for math (AlphaTensor, PRMs, GRPO), ML for math (FunSearch, AlphaEvolve, LeanDojo, symbolic regression). Navigate when: you want to understand what AI has actually achieved for mathematical reasoning and proof search.

---

## Algorithm Cooperation MOC

- [[Research/Algorithm Cooperation/_MOCs/_moc-algorithm-cooperation]] — **Cooperating partial oracles (the Mixer thesis)**: algorithm portfolios (Gomes-Selman), ManySAT clause sharing, CEGAR abstraction refinement, IDA*, CDCL/GRASP. The structural-motif reading path for why multiple incomplete solvers cooperating can outperform any single solver. Navigate when: you want to understand the theoretical and empirical foundation for the Mixer's architecture.

## Domains without a dedicated MOC yet

Interim navigation entries — promote each to a real `_moc-*` file once the domain grows.

- **Math Logic** (`Research/Math Logic/`, no `_MOCs/` yet): [[daniyarova-myasnikov-2025]] and [[daniyarova-myasnikov-2026]] (theory of interpretations I–II), [[pakhomov-solda-2025-generalized-higman]] (generalized Higman's theorem / iterated ideals), and the direction note [[_open-direction-wqo-ideal-kb-termination]] (wqo/ideal theory as a tool for B(2,5) KB termination).

- **Methodology / Experiment Tracking** (`Research/Methodology/Experiment Tracking/`): [[_synthesis-experiment-tracking-schemas]] — schema proposal synthesized from [[dvc]], [[hydra]], [[mlflow]], [[wandb]]. The synthesis is the navigation entry point until a MOC exists.

*This index is maintained by Researcher. Add a new entry here whenever a new MOC is created. Each entry: one-line description + navigation note ("navigate when: ...").*
