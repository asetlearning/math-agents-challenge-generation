# B(2,5) Benchmark — Run b25-reduce-core-benchmark-0001 (complete, 119 rows)

**Run**: `experiments/b25_reduce_core/runs/b25-reduce-core-benchmark-0001/`
**Provenance**: overnight 4-pass Rust beam search, binary `braid_reduce`, rules = `mega_ab_rules.live` (~25.7M rules), beam-width 16384, beam-secs 300 per pass.
**Source logs** (all under `runs/b25-reduce-core-benchmark-0001/logs/`):
- `overnight_4pass.log` — primary run, 84 targets (sorted smallest-first, up to 4 iterative passes)
- `remaining_4pass.log` — continuation for targets not yet complete, 19 targets (single `--num-passes 4` invocation)
- `retry_failed.log` — final retry pass for 16 remaining targets (single `--num-passes 4`)

**Cross-check**: all 119 `best_len` values confirmed against `data/overnight_results/*_best.txt` word lengths. Log and .txt agree exactly on all 119. No absent targets.

**Prior-snapshot gap status**: this run covers all 119 targets with fully identified provenance (overnight/remaining/retry logs). However, for 42 of 119 targets the `ui/benchmarks_data.json` best_len is strictly better than this run's result — meaning a different, still-unidentified run produced those JSON records. The 31 previously-untraceable rows are all in that 42. **The JSON provenance gap is NOT closed.** See section below.

---

## Log format

`overnight_4pass.log`: `[comm_X_Y] original=N (word i/119)` → `  pass k: M (Δ=d)` × (up to 4) → `  BEST: M (pct%) [done=N/119 improved=K]`

`remaining_4pass.log` / `retry_failed.log`: `[comm_X_Y] original=N (... word i/N)` → `<word text>` → `BEST: M (pct%) [improved=K]` — single `--num-passes 4` invocation; per-pass lines not logged; pass_count = n/a.

> **original_len** note: the log reads input length with `wc -c` which includes the file's trailing newline, so `original_len` here is exactly 1 greater than the word length (= `raw_len` + 1 vs. `ui/benchmarks_data.json`). Numbers are verbatim from logs.

---

## Key

- `passes` — number of improvement passes logged (1–4 for overnight; `n/a` for remaining/retry where format logs final only)
- `source` — which log file
- `‡ json=N` — `ui/benchmarks_data.json` shows a better (smaller) all-time best `N` from a prior/different run; this run did not match it

> † comm_12_9: log value 7,245 independently confirmed by `corrected/README.md` (chain: 28652 → 7245, abelianization (0,0) at all stages; see `corrected/final_beam.txt`).

> ‡ `json=N` entries: `ui/benchmarks_data.json` records a better all-time best `N` for that target. The JSON tracks cumulative bests across all runs; this run's result was not the best known. The source methodology for all 42 is now identified from the JSON `comment` field — see the "Provenance gap" section below.

## Targets absent from all three logs

None. All 119 targets present in `ui/benchmarks_data.json` appear in at least one log.

---

## Provenance gap NOT closed for 42 rows

For 42 of 119 targets, `ui/benchmarks_data.json` records a strictly better `best_len` than this run produced. All 31 previously-untraceable rows from the prior snapshot fall within this 42.

**Source methodology identified from JSON `comment` field** (not from logs — git history chase confirmed dead end: 1 commit, no history; runs were local):

| Category | Count | JSON comment | Source |
|---|---:|---|---|
| A | 8 | `Power + braid + greedy rules` | Earlier Python-only pipeline (power + braid + greedy rule application, no Rust beam). Reproducible with `reduce_coreless.py` (corrected). |
| B | 30 | `Rust beam + 7M historical rules` | Pre-benchmark-0001 run with a 7M rule bank. Run directory gone; outputs collected by `collect_best.sh`, then deleted from `benchmark_run/overnight_results/`. Rule bank not on disk. |
| C | 3 | `Lift→coreless→beam (new pipeline)` | `reduce_benchmark_v2.py` (lift-first strategy, `burnside_bidirectional` binary). Likely run on benchmark-0001 outputs as starting words — gets 9–10 chars better for these 3 targets. |
| D | 1 | `Multi-pass Rust beam + 25M biased rules (new record)` | Biased KB run for comm_16_2 only; specific run directory unlocated. |

**Disk search result (2026-06-10)**: Searched `benchmark_run/overnight_results/`, `benchmark_run/best_words/`, all per-target logs, `full_logged_progress.log` (73-word run using older `burnside/burnside_bidirectional` binary), `run_v2.log`, `analysis_output.log`, and `b25_bias_bidir/runs/*/run.log` files. `benchmark_run/overnight_results/` is empty — files were written there by earlier runs and subsequently deleted. Category B source confirmed absent from disk.
