# Tag Taxonomy — Math vault

The Math vault is **multi-user** (you + colleagues) and **multi-domain** (group theory is the current focus, but colleagues bring AI, CS, and methodology papers from their own work). Tags are the cross-cutting index that scales the vault to thousands of papers while keeping retrieval fast and the knowledge graph connected.

**Six tag axes.** A note carries 5+ tags from the mandatory axes, plus content-type and risk markers as relevant. Bases queries combine axes for filtered views.

## Vault language

**All notes are in English.** This includes paper summaries of non-English sources. Non-English source papers get their abstract and quotes translated to English in the body; mark translated text with `[trans.]`. The original-language text is **not** preserved in the vault — `language:` frontmatter records the source language for filtering, and readers needing the original follow the source URL. See `_templates/paper-summary.md` for full convention.

## Tag minimum per note

Every note carries at minimum:

1. One `#agent/*` — who wrote it (AI agent role or human)
2. One `#user/*` — which human contributor it belongs to
3. One `#domain/*` — broad field
4. **One-to-many `#topic/*`** — fine-grained subjects within the domain. Typically 4–10. No upper bound. Substance test: every tag must answer yes to "would I want this paper to surface when searching for this topic?" If the paper only mentions a topic in passing, don't tag it.
5. One `#status/*` — lifecycle

Plus mandatory in frontmatter: `author: <handle>` (the human who owns the note).

Optional but encouraged: `#project/*` (when the note belongs to a named project), content-type tags (`#paper`, `#experiment`, etc.), risk markers.

---

## Axis 1 — `#agent/*` (who wrote it)

- `#agent/lead`
- `#agent/dev`
- `#agent/research`
- `#agent/exp` — general Experimenter
- `#agent/exp-b25` — B(2,5) specialist Experimenter
- `#agent/validator`
- `#agent/math-expert` — math idea-generator / advisor (proposes mathematically-grounded ideas; NEVER certifies them — Validator alone gives math verdicts). Registered 2026-06-17.
- `#agent/human` — written by a human directly, no AI involvement

If a note was AI-written but human-tasked, `#agent/*` records the AI role and `#user/*` records the human who owns it.

## Axis 2 — `#user/*` (which human contributor)

Register a new tag for each new contributor as they join. Every note carries exactly one `#user/*` — the human who owns or commissioned it.

Registered handles:
- `#user/brett-b` — Brett A. Berger (see [[People/brett-b]])
- `#user/ethan-k` — Ethan Kalika (see [[People/ethan-k]])
- `#user/maumayma` — Maria Matveeva (see [[People/maumayma]])

Add new colleagues here as they join. Matching `author: <handle>` frontmatter is queried by Bases for grouping/filtering.

## Axis 3 — `#domain/*` (broad field)

Pick exactly one per note. **Don't add new domain values without registering them here first.** Researcher (with restructure authority) may extend this list when a colleague brings papers from a new field — register first, then tag.

Currently registered:
- `#domain/group-theory` — Burnside groups, KBMAG, finitely-presented groups, word problems, combinatorial algebra
- `#domain/ai` — AI/ML applied to mathematics, automated theorem proving, RL-guided search, learned heuristics
- `#domain/cs` — computer science: algorithms-as-implementation, systems, infrastructure, code-focused papers
- `#domain/methodology` — experimental methodology, benchmark design, statistical analysis, reproducibility (domain-neutral)
- `#domain/math-logic` — mathematical logic, reverse mathematics, order theory (wqo/bqo), proof theory, foundations. Registered 2026-06-20 for the Pakhomov-Soldà generalized-Higman paper. Relevant to the circle via Higman's lemma underpinning rewriting/Knuth-Bendix termination, but a distinct field from group-theory.

When a paper spans two domains (e.g. AI applied to group theory), pick the **primary** one — the field whose methodology the paper contributes to — and link to the other via wikilink. Don't double-tag domains.

**Methodology vs. contribution disambiguation.** When a paper's methodology and contribution point at different domains (e.g. Gröbner-basis methodology applied to a group-theory problem like Burnside / B(2,5)), the domain tag follows the **contribution**, not the methodology. The methodology is captured as a topic tag (e.g. `#topic/grobner-basis`). Rationale: a paper that solves a group-theory question using algebraic-tool X belongs to group theory; the tool is discoverable via the topic axis without polluting the domain axis. Refines the F4.2 default that routed `#domain/grobner → #domain/cs` — the default was correct for tool-papers in the cs subtree but wrong for tool-applied-to-other-domain papers like `[[grobner]]`.

## Axis 4 — `#topic/*` (fine-grained subjects, multi-tag)

This is the **connection-graph axis.** Topics are what the paper actually engages with — concrete subjects, named techniques, specific problems. Topics enable cross-domain retrieval ("all papers on `#topic/proof-search` regardless of `#domain/*`") and graph clustering.

Rules:
- **Typically 4–10 per paper.** No upper bound when all tags are substantive.
- **Substance test**: every tag must answer yes to "would I want this paper to surface when searching for this topic?" Passing mentions don't qualify.
- **Naming convention**: lowercase, hyphenated, specific. `#topic/burnside-groups` not `#topic/groups`. `#topic/buchberger-algorithm` not `#topic/algorithm`.
- **Reuse before invent.** Before creating a new topic, scan existing topic tags (Obsidian's tag pane). New topics earn their place when 2+ papers share them.

Initial seed (will grow as papers arrive):
- `#topic/burnside` — Burnside groups in general
- `#topic/b25` — B(2,5) specifically
- `#topic/word-problem` — word-problem decidability + algorithms

Distinct from Knuth-Bendix and coset enumeration.
- `#topic/restricted-burnside` — the restricted Burnside groups $B_0(m,n)$ (the largest finite quotient of the free Burnside group $B(m,n)$; order computed for specific cases, e.g. $|B_0(2,5)| = 5^{34}$). Tag when a paper engages specifically with $B_0$ vs $B$ (free), Hall's restricted-Burnside theorem, or the $B_0$ vs $B$ comparison. Substance test: the paper must say something non-trivial about the restricted vs free distinction.
- `#topic/growth-functions` — Cayley graph growth functions $f(k) = |B_k|$ for group quotient towers, sphere/ball growth, growth rates, Cayley graph diameters $D_{A_r}(G)$. Tag when a paper computes or studies the word-length distribution of group elements or growth properties of a group.
- `#topic/cayley-graphs` — Cayley graph construction, structural properties (diameter, girth, connectivity, spectrum), and algorithmic applications for finite and infinite groups. Tag when a paper's primary object is the Cayley graph geometry or when graph-diameter arguments drive key results.
- `#topic/finite-group-enumeration` — computational enumeration of elements, conjugacy classes, subgroups, or structural invariants (center, commutator subgroups) of finite groups, typically via Hall polynomial arithmetic or permutation representations. Tag when the paper's core contribution is a computational result about the structure of a specific finite group.
- `#topic/rewriting-systems` — term rewriting systems for groups: confluent and irreducible rewriting systems (string rewriting systems / Thue systems), KB completion, and algorithms for computing or manipulating rewriting systems in finite or infinite groups. Substance test: paper must engage with rewriting systems as a primary concept, not just mention KB in passing.
- `#topic/center-of-group` — center $Z(G)$ of a group, central elements, centralizers $C_G(x)$, and centralizer-based structural arguments (automorphism centralizers, involutive automorphisms). Tag when the paper computes or characterizes the center or a centralizer as a primary result.

### Instance-specific Burnside + Mathieu group topics (registered 2026-06-03 for Phase C experiment docs)

- `#topic/b43` — B(4,3) specifically: the Burnside group B(4,3) (free 4-generator group of exponent 3, order 3^29, finite). The Mixer's flagship convergence result (v10d overlap-scored injection, 33 min). Tag when a note's primary subject is B(4,3) experiments or results. Use alongside `#topic/burnside` for papers that span Burnside groups generally.
- `#topic/b53` — B(5,3) specifically: the Burnside group B(5,3) (free 5-generator group of exponent 3, finite).

- `#topic/mathieu` — Mathieu groups as a family: M11, M12, M22, M23, M24 (sporadic simple groups of this family). Tag when the primary subject is a Mathieu group but the specific instance is not the focus or when a note covers multiple Mathieu groups. Use alongside `#topic/m22` or `#topic/m23` for instance-specific notes.
- `#topic/m23` — M23 specifically: the Mathieu group M23 (sporadic simple group, order 10,200,960). KBMag mixing produces a **negative result**: every mixing variant tested is slower than RPO-only baseline (+27.7% to +75.6% slowdown, 3.8× baseline variance). Tag when a note's primary subject is M23 experiments or the mixing-harms-M23 finding.
- `#topic/m22` — M22 specifically: the Mathieu group M22 (sporadic simple group, order 443,520). A completed KB rule bank exists but no mixing experiment; driver script missing. Tag when a note's primary subject is M22.

- `#topic/g7` — G7: a KBMAG standard test group (harder than G5). KBMag mixing run was interrupted at 60s with 121k rules (injection fired at 106k). Tag when a note specifically concerns G7.
- `#topic/bidirectional` — Bidirectional KB / braid / word-reduction search: experiments that run search simultaneously from both ends (word and target) and meet in the middle. Distinct from `#topic/knuth-bendix` (unidirectional completion) and `#topic/proof-search` (general). Tag when bidirectional search is the primary algorithmic contribution.

### Phase C round-2 experiment topics (registered 2026-06-03)

- `#topic/generalized-tetrahedron-group` — Rosenberger-Scheer generalized tetrahedron groups: finite presentations of the form $\langle a, b, c \mid a^p = b^q = c^r = (ab)^s = (bc)^t = (ca)^u = e \rangle$ or variants. E35 belongs to a family of 5 unsettled finiteness cases (Rosenberger-Scheer). Tag when a note's primary subject is a presentation of this family. Useful as a seed tag even with a single instance — the other 4 unsettled cases may produce experiment notes.
- `#topic/sl-steinberg` — Steinberg presentations of special linear groups SL(n,q): the standard n-generator, q-relation KBMAG presentation following the `sl{n}{q}` naming convention (e.g. sl35 = SL(3,5), sl43 = SL(4,3), sl311 = SL(3,11)). Tag when a note's primary subject is a KB/mixing experiment on an SL(n,q) Steinberg-presentation. Distinct from `#topic/knuth-bendix` (the completion algorithm) — this tag captures the specific group family.

Tag when RL is the primary algorithmic contribution to a combinatorial-search experiment. Distinct from `#topic/knuth-bendix` (deterministic completion), `#topic/proof-search` (general search), and `#topic/algorithm-portfolio` (parallel search).

### AI-in-math topics (registered 2026-05-28 for Research/AI in Math/ batch)

- `#topic/automated-theorem-proving` — formal theorem proving systems (any methodology: LLM, search, symbolic, hybrid); the overarching field. Tag when the paper's primary contribution is a system that constructs or verifies formal proofs. Distinct from `#topic/proof-search` (which covers the search algorithm aspect) — this tag covers the full ATP system including training, architecture, and benchmark evaluation.
- `#topic/llm-prover` — language models applied to proof generation: LLM sampling over proof tactics or proof steps, fine-tuned LLMs for formal math, LLMs as the policy in proof search. Substance test: the paper must contribute a new LLM-based prover or a new training method for LLM provers.
- `#topic/autoformalization` — translation of informal mathematical statements or proofs to formal specifications (Lean, Isabelle, Coq, etc.): neural autoformalization, LLM-based translation, informal-to-formal pipelines. Tag when formalization of natural-language math is the paper's primary contribution.
- `#topic/agentic-reasoning` — agentic or multi-step reasoning systems for math: LLM agents that decompose problems into subgoals, maintain state across proof steps, call external tools (verifiers, symbolic engines), or self-correct based on feedback. Tag when the agent architecture (not just the model) is a primary contribution.
- `#topic/neuro-symbolic` — hybrid neural-symbolic systems: combining a neural component (language model, embedding, classifier) with a symbolic engine (geometry prover, SAT solver, CAS) in a tightly-integrated pipeline where both components are necessary. Substance test: the paper must use both components non-trivially — pure LLM calling a calculator is not neuro-symbolic; AlphaGeometry's iterative LLM-aux + symbolic-deduction loop is.
- `#topic/lean` — Lean proof assistant (Lean 3 or Lean 4) as the target formalization language or the development environment. Tag when Lean is the primary proof assistant the paper targets, not just mentioned as context. Closely related: `#topic/automated-theorem-proving`, `#topic/llm-prover`.
- `#topic/isabelle` — Isabelle/HOL as the target formalization language. Tag when Isabelle is the primary proof assistant. Distinct from `#topic/lean` (different systems with different type theories).
- `#topic/monte-carlo-tree-search` — MCTS or MCTS-inspired tree search algorithms applied to proof search, game-playing, or combinatorial optimization. Tag when MCTS is a primary algorithmic component, not just cited as background. Will appear in both sub-area A (HyperTree Proof Search) and sub-area B (RL-guided proof search).
- `#topic/reinforcement-learning` — reinforcement learning as the primary training or optimization methodology: policy gradients, value-function learning, PPO, GRPO, reward modeling, or RL-from-verifier-feedback. Tag when RL is the paper's core contribution, not just a minor component. Substance test: the paper must be primarily about how RL enables or improves a mathematical task.
- `#topic/value-network` — neural value functions that estimate the probability of success from a given proof state or search state; typically trained via RL or self-play. Tag when the value network architecture is a primary contribution or when the paper evaluates value networks specifically. Related: `#topic/monte-carlo-tree-search` (value networks typically guide MCTS).
- `#topic/process-reward-model` — reward models that evaluate the correctness or quality of each step of a multi-step mathematical reasoning chain, rather than only the final answer (outcome reward model / ORM). PRMs are used for RL training (step-level PPO) and inference-time verification (reranking). Tag when PRM design, training, or evaluation is the paper's primary contribution.

### ML-for-math topics (registered 2026-05-28 for Research/AI in Math/ML/ batch)

- `#topic/symbolic-regression` — methods that search for mathematical expressions (equations, formulas) fitting observed data or satisfying formal constraints; includes genetic algorithms, neural-guided regression, sparse identification. Tag when the paper's primary contribution is discovering or fitting symbolic mathematical expressions.
- `#topic/premise-selection` — selecting relevant premises (lemmas, axioms) from a library for a given proof goal; neural premise selection, embedding-based retrieval, and feature-based selection for ATP and ITP systems. Tag when the paper primarily addresses the premise selection sub-problem rather than full proof generation.
- `#topic/funsearch` — the FunSearch paradigm: iterative evolutionary LLM-guided program search, where an LLM proposes variants of a program/function and an evaluator scores them for fitness; discovered new solutions to mathematical problems (cap set bounds, bin packing). Tag when a paper uses or directly extends the FunSearch evolutionary-LLM search methodology. Also applies to AlphaEvolve (FunSearch's 2025 successor).
- `#topic/experiment-tracking` — tools, schemas, and workflows for tracking the configuration, outputs, and provenance of computational experiments: param logging, metric logging, artifact storage, run comparison, sweep management. Tag when a note's primary contribution is to experimental tracking infrastructure, not to the mathematical content of the experiments themselves.
- `#topic/reproducibility` — reproducibility of computational experiments: run provenance (git SHA, input hashes), deterministic execution, parameter capture, environment recording, and the ability to re-run or compare historical experiments. Tag when reproducibility is the primary concern, not just a passing mention.
- `#topic/braid-groups` — braid groups $B_n$ and their properties: Artin generators, word problem (decidable via Garside normal form), conjugacy problem, Dehornoy handle reduction, Nielsen-Thurston classification of braids. Tag when the paper's primary algebraic object is a braid group or the braid group structure is central to the results. Distinct from `#topic/braid-representations` (the linear-algebraic study of braid groups via matrices).
- `#topic/braid-representations` — linear representations of braid groups: Burau representation, Lawrence-Krammer-Bigelow representation, specializations and their faithfulness. Tag when the paper is specifically about whether a braid group representation is faithful, what its kernel contains, or properties of specific representations. Note: the Burau representation of $B_n$ over $\mathbb{Z}[t,t^{-1}]$ is faithful for $n \leq 3$, unfaithful for $n \geq 5$, and the $n=4$ case is the primary open question ([[Concepts/burau4-faithfulness]]).
- `#topic/divergence-and-stagnation` — the failure modes of completion-style procedures (Knuth-Bendix, Gröbner basis, saturation): cases where critical-pair / S-polynomial generation runs forever without termination, where orderings cycle, or where the search space explodes without useful reduction. Tag when a paper characterizes, analyses, or proposes heuristics for these failure modes. Cross-link: [[Concepts/kb-mixing-stagnation]].
- `#topic/automatic-groups` — groups for which the word problem is decidable by finite-state automata: regular-language dictionaries + multiplier automata satisfying the fellow-traveler property. Tag when a paper defines, characterizes, or exploits the automatic-group structure for computational group theory. Applied to KBMAG: many Burnside-adjacent problems are tractable precisely because the relevant groups are (bi)automatic.
- `#topic/cdcl` — Conflict-Driven Clause Learning: the modern SAT engine paradigm where conflicts (dead-ends in search) generate learned clauses that prune future search. The architecture underlying GRASP, MiniSAT, and ManySAT; applicable to any combinatorial search that can be encoded in propositional logic. Tag when CDCL is the paper's primary algorithmic contribution or the engine whose properties are being analyzed.
- `#topic/algorithm-portfolio` — the paradigm of running multiple algorithms (or algorithm configurations) in parallel on the same problem instance and sharing discovered information between them; each component provides partial information (local no-witnesses, learned clauses, rewrite rules) that improves the others. The formal name for the structural motif behind the Mixer. Tag when a paper directly contributes to the theory or implementation of portfolio solvers, including clause-sharing SAT and analogous mechanisms.
- `#topic/mathematical-discovery` — systems that discover genuinely new mathematical results (new bounds, new conjectures, new algorithms, new identities) not previously known to human researchers. Substance test: the paper must provide experimental evidence of a discovery that extends prior human knowledge, not just solve known problems faster. Applies to FunSearch (cap set bounds), AlphaEvolve (kissing number, matrix multiplication), Ramanujan Machine (new conjectures about mathematical constants).

### Kaplansky conjectures + computational search topics (registered 2026-06-13 for Group rings batch)

- `#topic/kaplansky-unit-conjecture` — the Kaplansky unit conjecture: for torsion-free group G and field K, the only units in K[G] are trivial units kg (k ∈ K×, g ∈ G); first stated Higman 1940, popularised by Kaplansky 1970; falsified by Gardam 2021 (char 2), Murray 2021 (all prime char), Gardam 2024 (char 0); zero-divisor and idempotent conjectures remain open. Tag when the unit conjecture itself (its proof, refutation, partial results, or the search for counterexamples) is the paper's primary contribution. See [[Concepts/kaplansky-unit-conjecture]].
- `#topic/kaplansky-idempotent-conjecture` — the Kaplansky idempotent conjecture: for torsion-free group G and field K, K[G] has no non-trivial idempotents (α² = α implies α = 0 or α = 1); still open in full generality; weaker than both the unit and zero-divisor conjectures (unit → zero-div → idempotent); proved for many group families (hyperbolic, bi-orderable, locally indicable) via Formanek's theorem and the trace method. Tag when the idempotent conjecture is the paper's primary concern.
- `#topic/computational-search-group-theory` — computer-aided search for algebraic objects in group-theoretic settings: units, zero-divisors, unique-product witnesses, or orderability failures in group rings, encoded as SAT/optimization problems or enumerated by exhaustive ball-search over Cayley graphs; includes Gardam's SAT-based counterexample to the unit conjecture and the semidecidability framing of these problems. Tag when algorithmic/computational search (not just computation of a group structure) is the paper's primary contribution to a group-theoretic problem.
- `#topic/unique-product-property` — a group G has the unique product property (UP) if for every pair of finite non-empty subsets A, B ⊆ G there exists an element uniquely expressible as a·b (a ∈ A, b ∈ B); UP implies the unit conjecture for K[G]; Rips-Segev 1987 first gave a torsion-free group without UP; Promislow 1988 exhibited the Hantzsche-Wendt group P (the eventual Gardam counterexample group) as failing UP. Tag when UP (or its failure) is a primary topic.
- `#topic/patternboost` — the PatternBoost methodology (Charton-Ellenberg-Wagner-Williamson 2024): iterative alternation of (1) local classical search generating many constructions and (2) global transformer trained on the best constructions that reseeds local search; finds new extremal-combinatorics constructions and counterexamples to open conjectures; related to FunSearch/AlphaEvolve (evolutionary LLM-guided search) but with a different architecture (learned global reseeding rather than LLM-proposed code variants). Tag when PatternBoost is the paper's primary methodology. See [[romera-paredes-2023-funsearch]] for the related FunSearch paradigm.
- `#topic/extremal-combinatorics` — extremal combinatorics: finding mathematical objects (graphs, sets, codes) that maximise or minimise a quantity subject to structural constraints; problems include cap sets, triangle-free graphs, Sperner systems, hypercube diameter; applies to FunSearch (cap set bounds), AlphaEvolve (kissing number), and PatternBoost (Graham hypercube conjecture, C₄-free graphs). Tag when the paper's primary mathematical domain is extremal combinatorics.

Grow the list organically. Don't pre-register topics that don't exist yet.

### Interpretation-theory topics (registered 2026-08-15 for the Daniyarova-Myasnikov "Theory of Interpretations" series)

- `#topic/category-theory` — categorical methods used as the primary proof apparatus: functors, natural transformations, 2-categories, categorical equivalence between two constructed categories. Tag when category theory is the mechanism a paper's main results are proved through (e.g. proving strong bi-interpretability of algebraic structures via equivalence of their categories of projective logical sets), not just a passing categorical remark. Distinct from `#domain/cs` category-theory-as-subject papers — here the domain follows the contribution (see the methodology-vs-contribution disambiguation note under Axis 3), so a categorical proof of a model-theoretic result stays `#domain/math-logic`.
- `#topic/logical-geometry` — Boris Plotkin's logical geometry program and its extensions: the classification of algebraic structures by which first-order-definable ("logical") sets they carry, generalizing universal algebraic geometry's classification by algebraic (equational) sets; includes projective logical geometry (the imaginary-elements extension, analogous to projective vs. affine varieties). Tag when a paper directly engages with logical-geometry classification (geometric/logical equivalence of structures, logical sets, or their categorical structure) as a primary subject, not just cites Plotkin in passing.
- `#topic/coherent-logic` — coherent first-order logic (formulae built from ∃, ∧, ∨, ⊤, ⊥ only, no negation) and its associated coherent categories (finite limits + pullback-stable images and joins); includes the syntactic-category construction for coherent theories and coherent functors between coherent categories. Registered 2026-08-21 for `[[darienzo-pagano-mcinnis-2020]]`. Tag when a paper's primary formal setting is coherent logic/coherent categories as a deliberate fragment choice (distinct from full classical or intuitionistic first-order logic), not just a passing use of ∃/∧/∨.
- `#topic/morita-equivalence` — Morita equivalence of first-order theories (in the sense of Barrett–Halvorson): a coarser notion of theory-equivalence than bi-interpretability, characterized via equivalence of classifying pretopoi (Tsementzis) and known to coincide with bi-interpretability exactly when coproduct Morita extensions can be eliminated (Tran-Hoang/McEldowney). Registered 2026-08-21 for `[[darienzo-pagano-mcinnis-2020]]`. Tag when a paper's primary or substantial concern is the Morita-equivalence/bi-interpretability comparison, not just a passing mention of Morita equivalence.

### Arithmetic-group model theory topics (registered 2026-08-22 for `[[sohrabi-myasnikov-2020]]`)

- `#topic/elementary-equivalence` — the model-theoretic relation $A \equiv B$ (two structures satisfy exactly the same first-order sentences); includes classification of all models elementarily equivalent to a given structure, first-order rigidity (when $\equiv$ forces $\cong$), and constructions of non-isomorphic elementarily-equivalent models (e.g. via deformation cocycles). Tag when characterizing or classifying the elementary-equivalence class of a specific structure is the paper's primary contribution. Distinct from `#topic/bi-interpretability` (a stronger, mutual-interpretability notion that often implies but is not implied by elementary-equivalence classification).
- `#topic/linear-groups` — classical matrix/linear groups over a ring or field ($\text{SL}_n$, $\text{GL}_n$, upper-triangular/Borel subgroups $\text{T}_n$, etc.) studied as the primary algebraic object, particularly their definability, interpretability, or model-theoretic structure. Tag when a specific linear group family (not an abstract or free/combinatorial group) is the paper's central object.
- `#topic/first-order-rigidity` — the property that every finitely generated (or otherwise constrained) group elementarily equivalent to a given group is isomorphic to it; a strictly weaker consequence of, but often proved via, bi-interpretability or QFA. Tag when first-order rigidity itself (proving it, or exhibiting its failure via non-isomorphic models) is a primary result.
- `#topic/quasi-finite-axiomatizability` — the QFA property (a structure's complete first-order theory, restricted to finitely generated models, is captured by a single sentence up to isomorphism); includes the Khélif-Nies bi-interpretability-with-$\mathbb{N}/\mathbb{Z}$ criterion for QFA. Tag when QFA (proving it, citing it as motivation, or relating it to bi-interpretability) is a substantive concern, not a passing mention.
- `#topic/number-theory` — rings of integers of number fields, their arithmetic (units, ideal structure), and algebraic-number-theoretic input to a paper's group-theoretic or model-theoretic arguments. Tag when the specific arithmetic of a number ring (not just "some ring") drives the paper's constructions or case-splits (e.g. finite vs. infinite unit group).
- `#topic/baumslag-solitar-groups` — the Baumslag-Solitar groups $BS(m,n) = \langle a,b \mid b^{-1}a^mb=a^n\rangle$ (metabelian when $m=1$), as the primary algebraic object of a paper: their presentation theory, elementary/first-order theory, decidability, or bi-interpretability. Tag when a Baumslag-Solitar group (any parameters) is the paper's central object, not just a passing example.
- `#topic/metabelian-groups` — metabelian groups (derived subgroup abelian) as the primary structural class under study, including their model theory, definability, and classification. Distinct from `#topic/nilpotent-groups` (a different, generally incomparable solvability-adjacent finiteness condition) — tag when metabelian-ness specifically drives the paper's methods or results.
- `#topic/group-cohomology` — cohomology of groups ($H^n(G,M)$, group extensions, the correspondence between equivalence classes of extensions and $H^2$) used as the primary technical tool for classifying groups up to isomorphism or elementary equivalence. Tag when a paper's classification or construction argument is driven by an explicit cohomological computation (extension classes, coupling maps, Ext groups), not just a passing mention of "cohomology."
- `#topic/polynomial-rings` — polynomial rings $R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ or Laurent polynomial rings over a base ring/field, studied as the primary algebraic object — their model theory, definability, interpretability, or elementary theory. Tag when a specific polynomial (or Laurent polynomial) ring construction is central to the paper's results, not just a passing algebraic tool.
- `#topic/non-standard-models` — non-standard models of a structure (elementarily equivalent but non-isomorphic models, typically arising from ultrapowers, compactness, or — as in the bi-interpretability literature — transported non-standard models of $\mathbb{Z}$ via an interpretation); includes explicit constructions of such models and classification results describing every elementarily-equivalent model as a non-standard model of a fixed base structure. Tag when constructing or classifying non-standard models is a primary contribution, not just a passing mention of "non-standard."
- `#topic/hyperbolic-groups` — (Gromov-)hyperbolic groups and their model-theoretic or geometric properties (thin triangles, negative curvature, torsion-free hyperbolicity). Tag when hyperbolic groups (or the hyperbolicity property itself) are a primary object the paper characterizes or contrasts against other group classes, not just a passing example.
- `#topic/nilpotent-groups` — nilpotent groups (finite lower/upper central series) as the primary algebraic object, including their model-theoretic classification, definability, or rigidity properties. Distinct from `#topic/burnside` (which covers bounded-exponent groups, a different finiteness condition) — tag when nilpotency specifically (not just "some finitely generated group") drives the paper's results.
- `#topic/second-order-logic` — weak or full second-order logic and its comparison to first-order logic: expressive-power results, interpretability of second-order quantification via first-order means (e.g. hereditary-finite-set superstructures), and structures where the two logics coincide. Tag when the paper's primary technical content concerns this first-order/second-order comparison, not just a passing mention of "second-order" as informal color.

### Representation & tokenization topics (registered 2026-07-17 for AXPLORER v1 representation-gate scan)

- `#topic/tokenization` — how a sequence is mapped to model input/output tokens: character-level, BPE/subword, fixed-width block/k-mer packing, or structured (tree/prefix) encodings; includes evidence on when representation choice measurably changes accuracy (Charton's linear-algebra encoding ablations, PatternBoost's BPE-vs-delimiter fix, arithmetic-task BPE failures). Tag when a paper's primary contribution or a substantive finding concerns how input/output is tokenized, not just that a model happens to use some tokenizer.
- `#topic/length-generalization` — a model's ability to handle sequences longer than (or of different length from) what it saw in training, and the architectural choices (positional encoding scheme, attention pattern) that enable or block it. Tag when length generalization or long-sequence positional-encoding choice is a primary empirical finding of the paper.
- `#topic/edit-representation` — models that generate or operate over edit operations / action sequences (insert-delete-substitute ops, rewrite-rule applications, tactic sequences) rather than the raw target sequence directly; includes Levenshtein/Insertion Transformers, neural program-repair edit models, and RL action encodings (AlphaTensor/AlphaDev). Tag when the edit/action-sequence representation itself (vs. raw generation) is the paper's subject.

### Wreath-product topics (registered 2026-08-28 for the Miasnikov Diophantine-problem line)

- `#topic/wreath-products` — restricted regular wreath products $A \wr B = (\bigoplus_{b \in B} A_b) \rtimes B$ and iterated wreath products, as the algebraic setting of a result (not as an incidental construction). Tag when the wreath-product structure is what the theorem is about: undecidability of the Diophantine problem in $\mathbb{Z} \wr \mathbb{Z}$ and its iterations, cyclic-retract / cyclic-centralizer criteria for transferring undecidability into $A \wr B$, or structural results about the base group and the acting group. Use alongside `#topic/diophantine-problems` and `#topic/decidability` when the contribution is a decidability verdict.

## Axis 5 — `#status/*` (lifecycle)

General lifecycle:
- `#status/draft` — work in progress, not yet reviewed
- `#status/review` — handed to Lead / Validator for review
- `#status/validated` — Lead or Experimenter approved (depending on note type)
- `#status/rejected` — explicitly killed; lessons captured
- `#status/superseded` — replaced by a newer note (link forward)
- `#status/reference` — reference material with no lifecycle; registered 2026-08-31

Experiment-specific:
- `#status/pending` — pre-registered, not yet run
- `#status/baseline` — single-algorithm reference established
- `#status/replicated` — re-run independently and confirmed
- `#status/inconclusive` — needs more seeds / data / parameter sweep

Math-claim-specific (Validator's verdict):
- `#status/proven` — Validator has produced a rigorous proof
- `#status/conjectured` — claimed but not proven; flagged for Validator follow-up
- `#status/disproven` — Validator showed it's false (or counterexample exists)

## Axis 6 — `#project/*` (optional — only when the note belongs to a named project)

Most paper notes won't have a project tag. Add `#project/*` only when the note is scoped to a specific project's workstream (an experiment, a code subsystem, a defined deliverable).

**Not a survey bucket.** Don't create `#project/*` tags for grouping papers by *what they study* (e.g. "all Burnside surveys" or "all Gröbner papers"). That's the job of `#topic/*` tags. Reserve `#project/*` for active named workstreams with concrete deliverables.

**Don't pre-register future workstreams.** A project earns a registered `#project/*` tag when it has active deliverables (code, experiments, a concrete plan). Until then, papers in preparation for that direction use `#topic/*` for retrieval. Pre-registration creates tags that never accumulate notes and pollutes the project pane.

**Multi-project tagging — allowed with soft cap of 2.** A note may carry more than one `#project/*` tag when it genuinely contributes to multiple named workstreams (substance test applies — every project tag must answer "would I want this note to surface when querying that project?"). Soft cap is 2; if you find yourself adding a third, you're probably topic-tagging — use `#topic/*` instead.

Currently registered:
- `#project/mixer-core` — general framework engineering (not specific to any one math problem)
- `#project/b25` — B(2,5), the flagship hard problem
- `#project/b43` — B(4,3)
- `#project/b53` — B(5,3)
- `#project/b29` — B(2,9) finiteness program. Registered 2026-08-11 on Maria's stage-2 GO (active deliverables: pq-tower experiment + runs/b29/, stage-1 synthesis, W1/W2 workstreams). Stage-1 notes predating registration carry `#topic/b29` only; new project-scoped notes carry both.

Add new `#project/*` tags as new projects start. Discuss in `_meta/canvas-setup.md` before adding to keep them stable.

## Optional axes

### Content type

- `#paper` — literature summary (mandatory on every paper note)
- `#experiment` — pre-registered experiment + results
- `#methodology` — methodology subnote inside an experiment folder (notes in `methodology/` subdirs)
- `#results` — results subnote inside an experiment folder (notes in `results/` subdirs — `<technique>-results.md` etc.)
- `#data` — data subnote inside an experiment folder (notes in `data/` subdirs — input dictionaries, raw run capture)
- `#experiment-type` — top-level `_type.md` describing what a methodology family is (e.g. `Rust Bidirectional/_type.md`)
- `#decision` — ADR
- `#review` — Lead's code review
- `#proof` — proof sketch or full proof (with Validator's verdict)
- `#concept` — note in `Concepts/` covering a reusable concept hub. **Not for single-concept definition / reference notes** (e.g. `Research/Group theory/General/basics/group.md`, `presentations-and-relations/free-groups.md`, etc.) — those live in their topic dir and carry **no content-type tag**; `domain/*` + `topic/*` handle retrieval. The `#concept` content-type signals "I am a hub that other notes reference"; standalone definitions are not hubs.
- `#synthesis` — multi-paper synthesis
- `#bug` — known bug, postmortem
- `#question` — open question for the human or for Validator
- `#convention` — meta-document defining how something should be done
- `#content-type/code-example` — runnable code snippet (one task per file, expected output captured verbatim). Used in `Research/Group theory/Tools/<tool>/examples/`.
- `#ai-discovery` — writeup of an AI-produced mathematical discovery (not a literature summary; used in `Research/AI in Math/Agents/`); registered 2026-08-31
- `#type/reference` — standalone reference note for a tool, library, or software component (not a paper summary; no academic venue). Used in `Research/<domain>/Tools/` subdirs. Distinct from `#paper` (requires academic publication) and `#concept` (cross-cutting concept hub). Registered 2026-06-13.

**One primary content-type per note.** A paper note gets `#paper`; an experiment note gets `#experiment`; a concept hub gets `#concept`. Don't carry both `#paper` + `#concept` on the same note — extract the concept content to a `Concepts/<name>.md` hub and link from the paper via `key_concepts:` frontmatter. Documented exception: a self-contained survey paper may carry `#paper` + `#synthesis` when the same note serves both functions (rare; substance test decides).

**Experiment-tree mapping.** Notes in the `Experiments/` subtree carry exactly one content-type tag matching their subdir role:

| Note location | Content-type tag |
|---|---|
| `<experiment-type>/_progress.md` (umbrella) | `#experiment` |
| `<experiment-type>/_type.md` (root) | `#experiment-type` |
| `<experiment-type>/methodology/<note>.md` | `#methodology` |
| `<experiment-type>/results/<note>.md` | `#results` |
| `<experiment-type>/data/<note>.md` | `#data` |

The experiment as a whole is identified by the umbrella `#experiment` tag on the `_progress.md` (or equivalent top-level summary). Do NOT use bare strings like `data` or `results` as tags — those aren't registered tags, just folder names; the registered tag forms are `#data` and `#results` (with the `#` prefix as Obsidian's tag pane requires).

**Inline `#concept/*` namespacing on non-concept notes is forbidden.** Concept content lives in `Concepts/<name>.md` hubs and links from papers via `key_concepts:` frontmatter (per [[paper-summary]] template). Paper-note tags never namespace into `concept/*` — that's a property of the concept hub, not the paper that references it.

### Paper-evaluation frontmatter (optional, on `#paper` notes)

- `relevance: 1|2|3` — Researcher's judgement of relevance to the active algo_mixing program. 1 = high (paper directly informs current experiments / methodology), 2 = medium, 3 = low. **Optional** — omit if unscored. Justification goes in `quality_notes:` body field (or expanded in the body's "Why this paper matters" section). Scoring rubric source: the originating synthesis note (e.g. `Research/Group theory/Open problems/_overview.md` for the open-problems batch). Queryable from Bases for ranking / filtering.

### Risk markers

- `#risk/high` — touches Mixer protocol, Rust ABI, on-disk format, or a math claim that other work depends on
- `#risk/breaking` — proposes a userspace break
- `#risk/unknown` — author unsure of blast radius

### Deprecated / dropped tags

These tag namespaces appear in historical notes but are dropped from current doctrine. Do not reintroduce. F4.3 migration removes them.

- `#score/1|2|3` — old inline relevance scoring on Open-problems papers. **Migrated** to optional `relevance: 1|2|3` frontmatter (see § Paper-evaluation frontmatter). Dropped 2026-05-28 in F4.2.
- `#project/none` — stale 7-axis escape hatch from when `#project/*` was mandatory. Project is now optional; "none" is not a valid value. Just omit `project:` when there is no project. Dropped 2026-05-28 in F4.2.
- `#project/burnside-other` — was used on one paper (`havas-newman-1980`) as a Burnside-surveys bucket. The project axis is for active named workstreams (b25/b43/b53/mixer-core), not group-family bucketing. Use `#topic/burnside` plus specific topic tags instead. Dropped 2026-05-28 in F4.2.
- `#domain/grobner` — never registered; appeared on one paper (`grobner.md`). Gröbner-basis work is migrated to `#domain/cs` + `#topic/grobner-basis`. The decision to register Gröbner (or SAT, biology) as a first-class `#domain/*` is deferred until that work has active deliverables justifying it. Dropped 2026-05-28 in F4.2.
- `#project/grobner` — appeared on one paper; never registered. Per § Axis 6 "Don't pre-register future workstreams", do not register until Gröbner has active code / experiments. Paper migrates to `#topic/grobner-basis` (+ `#project/b25` if substance test passes for B(2,5) contribution). Dropped 2026-05-28 in F4.2.

## How to retag existing notes

Researcher has restructure authority over `Research/` and `Concepts/`. When the taxonomy changes or a colleague brings new domains, Researcher may retag existing notes to match. **Log every retag** to `Agents/<user>/Researcher/log.md` with before → after.

Bases queries are the source of truth for "is the taxonomy actually being used consistently." If a Bases view shows orphan tags or untagged notes, that's a retag candidate.
