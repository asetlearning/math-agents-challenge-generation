# Installing the `/research` skill

> **Preferred route:** let an agent do this — see `SETUP.md` at the math-agents repo root. It installs this skill for both Claude Code and Codex and registers your handle. The steps below are the manual equivalent for Claude Code only.

This skill ingests papers into the shared Obsidian Math vault as structured summaries with a connection graph. Once installed, you can invoke it from any Claude Code session by typing `/research`.

## Prerequisites

1. **Claude Code installed.** See https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview.
2. **Access to the shared Obsidian vault.** Clone `https://github.com/ai-math-edu-lab/math-agents` — the vault root is `<clone>/obsidian` (workshop default clone location: `~/Desktop/math-agents`).
3. **A handle registered in the vault.** Edit `<vault>/_meta/tags.md` and add `#user/<your-handle>`, plus add yourself to `<vault>/People/<your-handle>.md` (use the existing `People/maumayma.md` as a template). Without this, the skill will ask you for your handle every session.

## Install

Skills in Claude Code live at `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/`. The simplest setup is a symlink from your local Claude config to the vault — that way, any updates Maria makes to the skill propagate to you without re-installing.

### macOS / Linux

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
ln -s ~/Desktop/math-agents/obsidian/_meta/skills/research ~/.claude/skills/research
```

Adjust the source path if your vault is somewhere else.

### Windows

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills"
Copy-Item -Recurse "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\math-agents\obsidian\_meta\skills\research" "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\research"
```

### Verify

Start a new Claude Code session in any project. Type `/research`. The skill should respond with the prompt for a paper URL or topic.

If it doesn't appear, check:
- `ls ~/.claude/skills/research/SKILL.md` returns the file (symlink resolved)
- You restarted Claude Code after installing
- The skill name in `SKILL.md` frontmatter is `research`

## Usage

Once installed, invoke from natural-language prompts in any project:

```
/research https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12345
```

```
/research https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12345 https://link.springer.com/article/...
```

```
"Summarize this paper for the vault: <url>"
```

```
"Do a literature pass on Buchberger algorithms with cooperation"
```

```
"Re-link all the Burnside papers using the current taxonomy"
```

See `SKILL.md` for the four supported modes and `workflows/` for what happens under each.

## What the skill writes to

The skill **only writes to the Obsidian vault.** It does not modify any files in your current working directory. Specifically:

- New paper summaries → `<vault>/Research/<domain>/<topic-path>/<paper-id>.md`
- Concept hubs → `<vault>/Concepts/<concept-name>.md`
- Syntheses → `<vault>/Research/<domain>/_synthesis-<topic>.md`
- Your log → `<vault>/Agents/<your-handle>/Researcher/log.md` (created on first use)

It does not touch:
- Other users' `Agents/<other-user>/` directories
- The vault's git state (the vault is not under git)
- Your local repo's `.git/`

## Updating the skill

Since the skill is a symlink to the vault, any updates Maria pushes to `<vault>/_meta/skills/research/` propagate automatically to your install. To verify you're on a recent version, check the SKILL.md modification date:

```bash
ls -la ~/.claude/skills/research/SKILL.md
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Skill doesn't appear after install**: restart Claude Code. Skills are discovered at session start.
- **`defuddle` returns nothing useful**: the page is image-only or behind a login wall. The skill will fall back to `WebFetch` or ask you for an alternative source.
- **Vault path is different on your machine**: tell the skill the local path on first invocation: "the vault is at `/path/to/Math/` on my machine."
- **You're getting permission errors writing to the vault**: ensure Claude Code's settings include the vault path in `additionalDirectories` and the Write tool is allowed for `<vault-path>/**`. Maria has docs on this in `<vault>/_meta/canvas-setup.md`.

## Questions

Ask Maria (`#user/maumayma`).
