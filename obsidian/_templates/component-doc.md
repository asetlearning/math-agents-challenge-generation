# <Component name> — <one-line tagline a human would understand>

## What it is

<One paragraph, 2-4 sentences. Plain English.>

## Why it exists

<One paragraph. The problem this solves or the design constraint it satisfies. If history matters, say so.>

## How it fits in the system

<2-4 sentences or a tiny ASCII flow. Wikilinks to neighbors.>

## Critical invariants — why each one exists

For each invariant in frontmatter, write a short narrative paragraph here.

### <invariant-id-from-frontmatter>
<2-4 sentences on why this matters, with concrete examples or past failures.>

## Public surface — what other components touch

The most common entry points:
- `<Type::method()>` — <plain English>

For the full type-and-line index, see frontmatter `public_api` or the upstream code.

## Hot path?

<One sentence.>

## Tests

<Short paragraph naming files and coverage. Machine-readable paths in frontmatter `tests`.>
