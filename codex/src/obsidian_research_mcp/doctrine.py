"""Doctrine loader.

The research-handle's *behavior* lives in the vault, not in this code:
- `_meta/agents/researcher.md`     — the agent prompt (source of truth)
- `_meta/agents/_common.md`        — shared multi-user conventions
- `_meta/tags.md`                  — 6-axis taxonomy (registered domains/topics)
- `_meta/naming-conventions.md`    — filename + placement rules
- `_meta/research-folder-convention.md`
- `_templates/paper-summary.md`    — exact output structure
- `_templates/concept-note.md`, `_templates/synthesis.md`
- `_meta/skills/research/SKILL.md` + `workflows/*.md` — the four modes

Loading these at session start is what guarantees ChatGPT produces the *same*
summaries as Claude. If the vault updates its doctrine, this server picks it up
automatically — no code change, mirroring the skill's symlink-propagation.
